State in React can be used to manage a component's state.

For Example, handling form elements via "state"

```js
const [color, setColor] = useState("#000000");
```

In the above snippit `#000000` is the initial value for the state.
`setColor` is a function that can be used to update the color state.

> State provide us the use of controlled elements
